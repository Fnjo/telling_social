                    The TELLING SOCIAL Terms of Service (the " agreement”) applies to TELLING and the client that
executes this agreement. This agreement determines the client’s use of the standard services of
TELLING SOCIAL (‘the Facebook Dashboard and the included services’). Upon accepting the offer of
TELLING SOCIAL – which includes these terms of service – the client confirms that the agreement
has been read and agreed to, and that the representative of the client is authorised to act on behalf of
the client.<br/><br/>
Subject to the foregoing, both parties agree on the following:

                <h3>DEFINITIONS</h3>
                <h4>Account</h4>
                <p>
                    An account represents one Facebook dashboard (TELLING SOCIAL) with the data and insights of one or several Facebook pages of one organisation (client).
                </p>
                <h4>Client</h4>
                <p>
                    An organisation that manage one or more Facebook pages and that has one or more
                    accounts.
                </p>
                <h4>Data</h4>
                <p>
                    The public and private data retrieved from Facebook using the API’s that Facebook
                    provides for this purpose. Private data is the data of a page that can only be retrieved
                    by the owner of the Facebook page and by people who have been granted permission
                    by the page owner.
                </p>
                <h4>Insights</h4>
                <p>
                    Information about the performance of a Facebook page and posts extracted from the
                    Facebook data with metrics, analytics, consultancy or another way.
                </p>
                <h4>TELLING</h4>
                <p>
                    TELLING (www.tellinginsights.com) is a department of FRANKADVIES, a Dutch
                    consultancy firm. TELLING and FRANKADVIES are therefore synonymous in this
                    agreement.
                </p>
                <h4>TELLING SOCIAL</h4>
                <p>
                    TELLING SOCIAL (www.tellingsocial.com) is a service of TELLING; see section
                    “SERVICE” for further information.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>SERVICE</h3>
                <h4>Facebook Dashboard</h4>
                <p>
                    TELLING offers Facebook pages a subscription to an online Facebook dashboard (TELLING SOCIAL)
                    for desktop and mobile devices. TELLING SOCIAL offers each client an overview of, and in-depth
                    insights into, the performance of their Facebook page(s) and its posts, as outlined on
                    www.tellingsocial.com.
                </p><p>
                    TELLING SOCIAL is developed by and exists as an (intellectual) property of TELLING. If TELLING
                    develops specific parts of the dashboard at the request of a client, the intellectual property rights of
                    these parts are owned by TELLING, unless otherwise determined with the client.
                </p>
                <h4>Training and support</h4>
                <p>
                Training and support on how to use TELLING SOCIAL is an integral part of the subscription to
                TELLING SOCIAL.
                </p>
                <p>
                TELLING offers training and support sessions via Skype. TELLING offers a 1-hour training session at
                the start of the subscription period. The support sessions are then provided at the request of the client,
                with a maximum of 1 hour per quarter per client. The costs of these sessions are included in the
                monthly fee of TELLING SOCIAL. The content and price of extra time or sessions will be agreed upon
                with the client prior to execution.
                </p>
                <h4>Analytics and consultancy</h4>
                <p>
                Analysing Facebook performance and advising our clients is an integral part of the subscription to
                TELLING SOCIAL.
                </p>
                <p>
                TELLING analyses the performance of Facebook pages in order to gain a better understanding of the
                root causes of performance and improvement opportunities – both as input for the continuous
                development of TELLING SOCIAL and in order to advise our clients about what to focus on to
                improve their Facebook performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                We share these insights with our clients in TELLING SOCIAL when relevant for all users, or in a
                private call when the insights are client-specific.
                </p>
                <p>
                TELLING also analyses the performances of Facebook pages upon request. This is an additional
                service on top of those provided within the subscription. The content and price of such an additional
                service are agreed upon with the client prior to execution.
                </p>

                <h4>Continuous improvement</h4>
                <p>
                Another integral part of the subscription to TELLING SOCIAL is the continuous improvement of
                TELLING SOCIAL and the development of new features with and for all clients. No extra costs will be
                charged for this, except when new features require operational costs. When additional costs are
                required, the client will be informed about the price (an increase of the monthly fee) and will have the
                option to add the new feature(s) or not. The monthly fee will then be increased from the moment that
                the feature is added to TELLING SOCIAL.
                </p>
                <p>
                TELLING also develops client-specific features at the request of the client as an additional service on
                top of those already included within the subscription. The specifications and costs of client-specific
                features are agreed upon with the client prior to execution
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>COSTS AND PAYMENT</h3>
                <h4>Costs</h4>
                <p>
                The cost of the subscription to the online Facebook dashboard and the included services are charged
                as monthly fees.
                </p>
                <p>
                The specifications and costs of additional services are agreed upon with the client prior to execution
                and invoiced in two terms: 50% before execution and 50% after completion.
                </p>

                <h4>Discount</h4>
                <p>
                TELLING offers a discount on the monthly fee to clients who introduce new clients. This discount is
                granted as long as these new clients remain clients of TELLING.
                </p>

                <h4>Payment</h4>
                <p>
                The monthly fee will be invoiced in the last week of the previous month. The maximum term of
                payment is 20 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                Invoices can be paid via bank transfer or PayPal.
                </p>
                <p>
                If an invoice is not paid within 20 days, TELLING will send the client a reminder. After 40 days the
                client will receive a second reminder. If the invoice has not been paid after 60 days, the client has
                automatically been in default for 40 days. In this case, the client owes a legal (trade) interest on the
                outstanding amount. The interest on the due and payable amount is calculated from the moment the
                client is in default until the moment that the invoice has been paid in full. With an outstanding charge
                of up to € 267, these costs will be € 40. For higher charges (up to € 2,500) the costs stand at 15% of
                the outstanding amount.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>SUBSCRIPTION</h3>
                <h4>Annual subscription</h4>
                <p>
                TELLING SOCIAL and its included services are offered as an annual SAAS subscription. The
                subscription will be automatically renewed each year.
                </p>

                <h4>A 14-day trial period</h4>
                <p>
                Each client is offered a free trial period of 14 days. A maximum of one Facebook page can be
                analysed by TELLING SOCIAL during the trial period. Extra pages can be added at the start of the
                annual subscription.
                </p>

                <h4>Terminate a subscription</h4>
                <p>
                The client can terminate the subscription with due consideration of a notice period of 30 days before
                the end of the annual subscription period.
                </p>

                <h4>Adding or removing Facebook pages</h4>
                <p>
                During the subscription, a client can have additional Facebook pages added to or removed from
                TELLING SOCIAL. The monthly fee will then be adjusted accordingly. TELLING SOCIAL needs to
                have access to at least one Facebook page during the subscription period.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>ACCESS TO FACEBOOK DATA</h3>
                <p>
                In order to offer the client insights into the performance of Facebook pages and posts, TELLING
                retrieves and stores the Facebook data of these pages and posts. TELLING can retrieve Facebook
                data when it is assigned the role of ‘analyst’ on the client’s Facebook page(s). Therefore, the client
                must assign TELLING the role of ‘analyst’ on their Facebook page(s).
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>PRIVACY AND SECURITY</h3>
                <h4>Data of Facebook users</h4>
                <p>
                TELLING retrieves and stores Facebook data. In accordance with new privacy regulations, TELLING
                does not retrieve or store the private information of individual Facebook users, only demographic
                information of Facebook users on an aggregated level as provided by Facebook.
                </p>

                <h4>Data of clients and users of TELLING SOCIAL</h4>
                <p>
                TELLING stores the following private information about clients and the users of its dashboard:
                </p>
                <p>Clients</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Name</li>
                    <li>Email addresses of contact persons</li>
                    <li>Tax number</li>
                    <li>Quotes</li>
                    <li>Invoices</li>
                    <li>Facebook access tokens</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                TELLING requires and uses this information for account- and financial management and to retrieve
                clients’ Facebook data. The data will be stored as long as the client is a client of TELLING.
                </p>
                <p>Users</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Email addresses</li>
                    <li>Usernames</li>
                    <li>Encrypted passwords</li>
                    <li>Usage data of users: viewed tabs in TELLING SOCIAL and the timestamps of these views</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                TELLING requires and uses this information to give users access to TELLING SOCIAL and to monitor
                the usage of TELLING Social. The data will be stored as long as the client is a user of TELLING
                SOCIAL.
                </p>
                <p>
                Each client knows the email addresses and user names that TELLING stores, because they are
                provided to TELLING by the client under the ‘User tab on TELLING SOCIAL. Client users with
                administrative rights have access to this tab. Passwords are encrypted, so that neither TELLING nor
                anyone else can read them.
                </p>

                <h4>Security</h4>
                <p>
                Each Facebook user receives a personal account from TELLING. The user can use this to choose a
                personal password and to get access to TELLING SOCIAL. Passwords are encrypted – neither
                TELLING nor anyone else can read them.
                </p>
                <p>
                Only the user is allowed to use his or her personal account and password. The user must keep the
                account details and the password strictly confidential.
                </p>
                <p>
                The user is responsible for all actions after logging in with the account details and the password. If the
                account information and password are known to others, the user is obliged to report this to TELLING
                or to the person with an administrator role on TELLING SOCIAL at the client, so that the account can
                be deleted and a new account can be created for the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                TELLING has the right to block a user or a client account. TELLING can do this if TELLING has
                reasonable suspicion that one or more users are acting or have acted in violation of the law or the
                contracted agreement. TELLING is also entitled to choose other actions than blocking.
                </p>

                <h4>Facebook data and insights</h4>
                <p>
                TELLING has access to your Facebook data and treats both this information, as well as the insights
                provided by TELLING SOCIAL, analytics and consultancy, as confidential.. TELLING does not share
                any data or insights of clients with other parties.
                </p>
                <p>
                Access to the data and insights of each client is limited to the authorised personnel of TELLING and
                the client, as well as all users to whom the client has given access to TELLING SOCIAL.
                </p>
                <p>
                Since clients can add users themselves, it is the client’s responsibility to monitor which users have
                access, and ensure that these users treat the provided insights as confidential.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <h3>DISCLAIMER</h3>
                <p>
